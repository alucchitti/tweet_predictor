415,Great question! Every spinoff was so fun for different reasons. I would say my least favorite spinoff was the Hamptons. Just because we were all in weird places in our lives. The rest were so much fun #KUWTK https://t.co/uYJVanpTQL,0

431,Ok the water bottle is back https://t.co/L852l9L7KI,0
432,I mean the drama over water LOL I’ll keep my jug of water to myself moving forward 💜,0
433,I’m always down to learn and I’ll see how that incorporates into my life. Hopefully We all do our part in our own ways. I’m proud of us all for doing our best and simply trying. But these stories sayin I’m shaming peps is BS because I’m a baby at this stuff myself 💜💜,0
434,Sometimes it’s what I grab. It’s not about being perfect. It’s about learning and hopefully making small changes for our future. Holy smokes. Anyways I love when I get educated on easy tips as to how to potentially make a change in our world. Feel free to tweet me some tips.,0
435,I was trying to provide a suggestion such as a water filtration system that you can buy easily for the price of a case of water bottles. Sometimes plastic water bottles are the only option for some people and I totally get that.,0
436,how much more I have to learn. All I was simply saying is a pet peeve of MINE. I find it silly that people are pouring 4 to 5 single use plastic bottles into a reusable container. It’s sort of defeats the purpose.,0
437,Oh my! LOL What drives me 🤪 is that people turn nothing into some thing. It must be a slow news day. I am constantly learning and trying to be better for the environment for the sake of my daughter. I am the last one to say that I’m super environmentally conscious because I know,0

439,@bekkiarnold Oh my goodness you’re not lazy at all. I am literally crazy! Everyone does things in the way that fits best with our schedules. I would not suggest anyone to wake up at four LOL I think it’s crazy but now I’m so used to it ❤️❤️,0

508,@khloeart When I wear heels I’m def over 6 feet,0
509,@Aussie_Kardash I don’t think I’m that tall either. But there’s a difference w me &amp;Kendall. We are very close in height but I am curvier. shes super slender. When you’re tall and super thin it makes you look even taller. No1 thinks I’m as tall as I am when they meet me but the ruler doesn’t lie,0
510,@kamarikardash You look so beautiful! But yes maintaining all of the fucking beauty treatments is definitely a full-time job! It’s worth it though,0
511,@DramaKing25 @njkardashian @Khlomoney98 @Khlocaine_ I’m tall and fabulous. That’s what it equals,0
512,@kenzkardash Really?! Let me research this. Lex showed me a tweet where someone told me to put on wet socks so I don’t know if you guys are just fucking with me,0
513,@njkardashian @Khlomoney98 @Khlocaine_ Hahahahah omg The insults about being so short LOL I am between five 9 1/2 and 510 thank you very much. Ok really 5’9.5 but I think 5’10 sounds nicer,0

518,I mean.... the extent people go through,0
519,@Khlocaine_ Hahahaha I love you. So on the pic next to Kylie I am leaning back on the wall and my legs are kind of staggered forward so I’m leaning so I look a little shorter. Does that make sense? I don’t wanna look like a giant standing next to her. Although she is perfect height,0

1224,@TrulyAKhloeKFan My speed walk at 3.5 on a 8 incline I can do for an hour and I’m dripping wet. I just depends how long your legs are and what your endurance is. But I hate running. So I like my brisk walk. And that can be great cardio,0
1225,@TrulyAKhloeKFan I don’t really love the treadmill but I do it every day to warm up but I go at an incline and I just do a speed walk and I warm up. when I have to do sprints those are in short intervals. I range anywhere from 7mph to maybe 11 mph but super short. 30sec intervals. Hate running Ha,0
